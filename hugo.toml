Given the item I want to find and the website, the program scrapes a few product listings from the given site, uses vector embeddings to ensure the result is relevant and hands it to an LLM, which searches and fetches me the prices. In agentic mode, the agent verifies that scraped results do not exceed my budget per figure and outputs the cheapest listing."
